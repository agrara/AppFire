This code is written in C++ for a console application. 
Under Linux system build-essentials should be installed prior compiling the code.
Under Windows there are plenty of IDEs containing integrated compilator or you can use CygWin or Mingw for compiling without installing a dedicated IDE.

From the terminal window navigate to the folder where the files are.
Use command: g++ main.cpp task.cpp (for compiling).
A new file called a.out should appear in the folder.
Start it with the command: ./a.out

When new tasks are entered they will be saved on exit in a file called tasks.txt(this file shoud be considered as the export file required in the task assignment).
When tasks.txt file exist the application will load all the data in it upon start.
